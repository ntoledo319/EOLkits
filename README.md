# EOLkits — Migration Kits for AWS Platform Deprecations

> CLIs for the AWS deprecation deadlines that break production. **Amazon Linux 2 is now past EOL (Jun 30, 2026).** Also: **Lambda Python 3.9/3.10/3.11** waves, and the Lambda Node.js 16/18/20 block cliffs (**Feb 1 / Mar 3, 2027**).

> **Amazon Linux 2 reached end-of-life on Jun 30, 2026 — it is now unpatched.** Anything still pinned to AL2 (launch templates, EKS/ECS node groups, Beanstalk platforms, Lambda base images) gets no new AMIs and no security backports. The `al2023-gate` CLI below is free and MIT-licensed — clone it, scan your accounts, and run the migration yourself. If you'd rather have it done for you, the team offers a paid audit that scores every finding and hands back a roll-forward plan: [eolkits.com/audit](https://eolkits.com/audit).

AWS is killing runtimes on a hard schedule. When a deadline passes, deploys fail, functions get frozen, AMIs stop receiving patches. Most shops find out in production.

**EOLkits ships one CLI per deadline.** Each kit scans your accounts, rewrites the broken code, patches the IaC, generates a safe canary plan, and produces a rollback script. All kits work offline via fixtures so you can evaluate before you run them against AWS.

## The deadlines

| Kit | Deadline | What breaks | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**al2023-gate**](./kits/al2023-gate) | **Jun 30, 2026** — Amazon Linux 2 EOL | `yum`, `amazon-linux-extras`, `ntpd`, `iptables`, Python 2 | **Live deadline** |
| [**python-pivot**](./kits/python-pivot) | **Lambda Python 3.9/3.10/3.11** EOL waves | `distutils`, `imp`, `collections.Mapping`, native wheels | Active |
| [**lambda-lifeline**](./kits/lambda-lifeline) | Apr 30, 2026 — Lambda Node.js 20 EOL (Phase 1, **passed**) | `require()`, `aws-sdk` v2, `URL` globals, OpenSSL 3 hashes | Post-deadline cleanup |

> Phase 1 for Node.js 20 ended Apr 30, 2026 — security patches stop. Per AWS's runtime schedule, block-create for `nodejs20.x` lands **Feb 1, 2027** and block-update **Mar 3, 2027** — the same dates apply to `nodejs16.x`, `nodejs18.x`, `python3.9`, and `python3.10`. After block-update an affected function can't be changed at all; the only path is a full redeploy on a supported runtime. `lambda-lifeline` is the cleanup path before that cliff.

Every kit ships the same 6 pillars:

1. **scan** — enumerate affected resources across regions (fixture or live via boto3)
2. **codemod / remap** — rewrite source and config to the new runtime
3. **audit** — find the dependency landmines (native wheels, deprecated modules)
4. **iac** — patch SAM / CDK (Python+TS) / Terraform / Serverless / Packer / Ansible
5. **deploy** — staged canary (5 → 25 → 50 → 100) with CloudWatch alarm rollback
6. **rollback** — one command back to the previous version

## Install

Each kit is standalone. `al2023-gate` and `python-pivot` are Python CLIs; `lambda-lifeline` is a Node CLI. Clone and install the one you need.

For the live deadline (AL2 → AL2023, Jun 30):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntoledo319/EOLkits.git
cd EOLkits/kits/al2023-gate   # or kits/python-pivot
pip install -e .
al2023-gate --help
```

For Node 20 cleanup (before the Mar 3, 2027 block-update cliff):

```bash
cd EOLkits/kits/lambda-lifeline
npm install
npm link
lambda-lifeline --help
```

The Python kits require Python 3.10+. Live mode uses `boto3`; fixture mode requires nothing.

## Hosted fulfillment on GRACE

The hosted EOLkits site now targets the GRACE deployment shape:

- `eolkits.com` is the existing static GRACE satellite.
- selected API paths on `eolkits.com` are reverse-proxied to the paid fulfillment API satellite.
- Uploads, report PDFs, idempotency, verification records, and jobs use the GRACE VPS filesystem + local SQLite state instead of Cloudflare KV/R2/Queues.

See [`deploy/grace/README.md`](./deploy/grace/README.md) for the exact no-duplicate wiring. Keep the existing `eolkits` static satellite; add only `eolkits-api` for paid API/webhook fulfillment.

## GitHub Action

Run the free PR check from GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- uses: ntoledo319/EOLkits@v1
  with:
    kit: auto
    path: .
    fail-on: high
    comment-pr: true
```

The action runs dry-run, path-safe checks from all three kits and can comment findings on pull requests.

## 30-second demo

Live deadline first — Amazon Linux 2 → AL2023:

```bash
# Scan what's about to break (offline, no AWS creds needed)
al2023-gate scan --fixture test/fixtures/inventory.json --format table

# Remap package names (yum → dnf, retired packages → replacements)
al2023-gate remap --packages packages.txt

# Patch cloud-init / launch-template / Packer / Ansible
al2023-gate cloudinit --path user-data.yaml --apply

# Generate the rollout runbook for EKS / ECS / Beanstalk / ASG
al2023-gate runbook --target eks
```

Same shape for `python-pivot` and `lambda-lifeline` — see each kit's README for the full walkthrough with captured output.

## Why this exists

AWS publishes deprecation notices on a blog. Your deploys will fail on a Tuesday. The fix is usually not one-line — it's native wheels that don't exist for the new runtime, OpenSSL 3 hashes your code depended on, an IMDSv1 call that's now blocked, an `iptables` rule that no longer works on nftables.

EOLkits automates AWS migrations off deprecated runtimes — deterministically, safely, and before the deadline. It's opinionated, well-tested (149 tests across kits + apps), and safe — everything is dry-run by default, everything has a rollback path.

---

## Tests

```bash
# lambda-lifeline: 24 tests (Node, node --test)
cd kits/lambda-lifeline && npm test

# al2023-gate: 48 tests
cd kits/al2023-gate && pytest -q

# python-pivot: 44 tests
cd kits/python-pivot && pytest -q

# apps/runner: 7 tests
cd apps/runner && pytest -q

# apps/worker: 3 tests (vitest)
cd apps/worker && npm test
```

149 passing across kits + apps (al2023-gate 48, python-pivot 44, lambda-lifeline 29, runner 8, worker 8, grace-api 12 — counted 2026-06-09).
